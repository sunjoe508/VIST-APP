### Developer Guide for Vist App

This guide covers detailed instructions to set up, develop, and deploy both the front-end and back-end for the Vist App. Each section will walk you through setting up your environment, understanding the app structure, developing, and troubleshooting. 

---

## Project Overview

**Vist App** is designed with a modular structure, separated into front-end and back-end directories:

- **Front-End (Client)**: The user interface and client-side logic, including all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for interacting with the application.
- **Back-End (Server)**: Handles all server-side operations such as data processing, user authentication, and database management using Node.js and Express.

## 1. Environment Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Project Repositories

First, clone both the client (front-end) and server (back-end) repositories to your local machine:

1. Clone the front-end repository into a `client` folder.
2. Clone the back-end repository into a `server` folder.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Navigate to each project directory (client and server) and install dependencies:

1. **Client**: Use `npm install` to install front-end packages (if using a JavaScript framework).
2. **Server**: Use `npm install` to set up all back-end dependencies, including Express, Mongoose, and any authentication-related packages.

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

For the back end, set up a `.env` file in the `server` folder to store important environment variables securely. For example, you might define variables such as `PORT`, `DATABASE_URL`, and `JWT_SECRET`.

## 2. Front-End Development

The front-end is structured with a focus on user experience (UX) and a responsive design. The UI is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a clear organization of assets, styles, and scripts.

### Directory Structure

The front-end is organized into folders to streamline development:

- **`assets/`**: Contains images, fonts, and other static assets.
- **`css/`**: Holds all styling files, including a main stylesheet and any additional CSS for responsiveness.
- **`js/`**: Includes JavaScript files to handle client-side functionality.

### Key Front-End Pages

1. **Landing Page (index.html)**: Introduces users to the Vist App with a hero section, navigation, and links to sign in or sign up.
2. **Dashboard Page**: The main user interface for logged-in users, displaying personal data and interactive sections.
3. **Authentication Pages (Login/Signup)**: Secure pages that allow users to create accounts or sign in, leveraging form validation.

## 3. Back-End Development

The back-end is built with Node.js and Express, which manage user data and interactions with the MongoDB database. 

### Directory Structure

The back-end is structured with MVC (Model-View-Controller) principles to organize code effectively.

- **`models/`**: Contains schemas and data models, such as the User schema.
- **`controllers/`**: Defines functions to manage API requests, like registration and login.
- **`routes/`**: Sets up routes that direct incoming requests to the appropriate controllers.
- **`middleware/`**: Includes authentication and error handling functions.

### Key Back-End Modules

1. **User Authentication**: Handles registration, login, and session management using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for security.
2. **Data Storage**: Connects to MongoDB to store and retrieve user data, ensuring persistence.
3. **API Routing**: Sets up RESTful endpoints to serve client requests.

## 4. Running the Application

1. **Front-End**: Use a local development server to run the front end, such as Live Server in Visual Studio Code, or manually open `index.html` in a browser.

2. **Back-End**: Start the server with `node app.js` (or `npm start` if configured) to enable the back-end API functionality.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

- **Database Connection Issues**: Verify the `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`.
- **Authentication Errors**: Ensure JWT secret in `.env` matches whatâ€™s specified in the code.
- **Styling Issues**: Check for CSS conflicts or missing stylesheets.
